<p>I hadn't planned on eating much ramen in Kyoto, but I couldn't pass up trying Men Baka Ichidai. A few blocks from Nijo Castle in the heart of Kyoto is a little ramen shop with a particularly explosive special.

The "Negi Ramen" or "Fire Ramen" is popular because they, well, set it on FIRE before serving. For all intents and purposes, it's an otherwise excellent bowl of shoyu (soy broth) ramen, but the catch is the chef pours a serving of heated green onion oil over it before you eat it. As you can see, it ignites in a giant plume of flame. Before he does so, the counter (which is noticeably blackened) is covered with wet towels and he cautions you to remove all your belongings from the counter, wear a paper apron to protect yourself from splashing oil/flames, and don't get up or scream. The ramen, while excellent and little extra oily, doesn't actually taste particularly like it was just engulfed in flames. Check out a video I shot of the process
