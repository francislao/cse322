<p>Bar High Five in Ginza and bartender Hidetsugu Ueno (formerly of Star Bar) are known for making some of the best cocktails in Tokyo. In his trademark suspenders and Elvis pompadour, Hidetsugu made me a couple of the best cocktails I've ever had. Then he made me a hotdog. I had read about the hotdog prior to my trip and asked him about it. It's one of Bar High Five's specialties and is topped with a housemade Bourbon Sauce. Naturally, the hotdog is paired with a Bourbon and Soda. It's an extremely simple presentation, but the flavors are wonderfully complementary and probably one of the few ways I'd be unashamed to admit I had a hotdog in Japan. </p>
