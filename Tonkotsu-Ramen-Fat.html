<p>Blocks from the Hakata train station is a major shopping center, Canal City. On the 5th floor is a food court, similar to Ramen Street in Tokyo Station, called Ramen Stadium. It houses 8 ramen shops that represent regional styles from all over Japan. One of the 8 is another export to New York, Hide-Chan. I ordered another bowl of tonkotsu (pork bone broth) with pieces of fried pork fat. Extremely rich and fatty. At this point I was getting a bit of ramen fatigue, but I still had no trouble getting through the bowl. </p>
