<p>The most noticeable thing about Ganko (meaning "grumpy" in Japanese) from the outside is that it's not noticeable at all. Down a narrow alley (as most of these places seem to be) you'll find a black tarp covered shelter jutting out from a building with no signs or windows. Only a giant bone suspended from a chain to give any indication that there's something special inside. Inside you'll find a 5 seat counter where an old bearded man inside shuffles about his tiny kitchen assembling bowls of excellent shio (salt broth) ramen that he tops with hot shrimp oil. I understand that his recipe is so exact that he won't open if he doesn't think the broth is up to his standard on a given day. Thankfully that wasn't the case when I dropped by. </p>
