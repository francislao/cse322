<p>The Nishiki Food Market is a series of covered blocks lined with kiosks and shops selling all kinds of Japanese food. You can get anything from fresh fish, candy, to cooking knives. It's also a great place to grab food on the go. I walked down the streets and picked up a bunch of skewers of a variety of foods. Clockwise from the top left is: a coal grilled rice cake that is served brushed with soy sauce and a sheet of seaweed, a steamed sweet potato, pumpkin, and carrot cake, and an overflowing container of deep fried beef and onion skewers. Extremely cheap and tasty. </p>
