<p>Nagi Ramen has been featured on Serious Eats before recently (link) and for good reason.
Nagi is located in the Golden Gai district of Tokyo and is full of tiny back alleys lined with one room bars and restaurants. 
Nagi is an equally cramped space up a narrow set of stairs from where the chef calls the next customer up from a tube leading out to the street. 
Nagi specializes in a shoyu (soy) broth with niboshi (dried baby sardines) that gives a decidedly fish flavor. 
The ramen also comes with two types of noodles: a very thick, chewy noodle and another wide noodle that's a little akin to drunken noodles. It's a unique and tasty ramen experience.
