<p>Another thing Fukuoka is famous for is the legion of yatai (street food carts) that come out in the evenings. They serve everything from sushi to yakitori and, of course, tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen. There's a large concentration of them along the banks of Nakasu Island in the middle of the canal that bisects Fukuoka and they're usually packed. I grabbed a bowl of ramen at, again, the one with the biggest crowd. A great bowl of Hakata-tonkotsu ramen while rubbing shoulders with locals and having broken conversations lubricated by beer and food. </p>
