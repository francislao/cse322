<p>Afuri is another small ramen shop a short walk from the Harajuku station in Tokyo. It specializes in a yuzu-shio ramen which is a shoyu (soy broth) ramen with a light citrus flavor. It's much lighter than most ramen and is apparently rated highly as a ramen fit for women. But it's still excellent for any gender. Another plus to Afuri is that they coal grill their charsiu, on a tiny grill barely wide enough for 3 pieces, giving the ramen a nice smokiness. </p>
