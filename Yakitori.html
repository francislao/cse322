<p>Ginza is known for its upscale shopping and restaurants, but just on the margins are a lot of great, cheap spots. Underneath the train tracks by the Ginza station is a cramped, smoky yakitori spot called Yakitori Ton Ton. It's one of many street-side havens for cheap food and beer you'll find in Japan where salarymen come to unwind for hours after the workday. I sampled the pork, pork gizzard, chicken, and chicken meatballs. The pork gizzard was a little salty, but the rest were dangerously addictive. The chicken meatballs especially kept me there for several more orders. </p>
