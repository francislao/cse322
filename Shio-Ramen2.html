<p>Major train stations in Japan are usually also giant hotels, shopping centers, and food courts. Underneath Tokyo Station is a labyrinth of shops, kiosks, and restaurants. There's one corridor, dubbed Ramen Street, that houses 8 adjacent ramen restaurants. A handy thing to have while waiting for a train. I actually didn't know the name of any of these places, I just stood in the longest line. This strategy usually worked for me and this time was no exception. I sat down to a bowl of excellent shio (salt broth) ramen and slurped it up while commuters hurried in and out. </p>
