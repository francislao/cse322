<p>Upon arriving in Fukuoka, the first thing I did was drop my bags at my hostel and run out the door in search of the original Ippudo. Tucked in an alley of the Daimyo neighborhood, there was already a giant line outside. When I finally got inside, I ordered the familiar Akamaru Tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen with extra charsiu (dubbed Akaniku, niku for meat) and was treated to one of the best bowls of ramen I've ever had.

It might be a romanticized hyperbole, but the anticipation made it all the better. Japanese food is often much more mild than American food and, while that's generally true, Ippudo's broth is so rich and flavorful that it really stood out compared to the other food I'd had. If only this place weren't halfway around the world.</p>
