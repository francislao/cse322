<p>After Tokyo, I made my way to a pair of historic, preserved postal towns in the Kiso Valley. They're connected by a 5 mile trail through the mountains. I started in Magome and had lunch at a small soba shop. I was served as a traditional teishoku (a set meal) with warm soba, fish, mochi balls, and a smattering of small dishes. It was a great piece of old Japan to be in a 100-year old town and having the same meal postmen might have had passing through ages ago. </p>
